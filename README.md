# Inconsistent Blank Images from Expo Camera in Custom Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera API intermittently produces blank images when integrated into a custom component. The issue occurs without any apparent error messages in the console, making debugging challenging. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides a potential fix.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar environment.
4. Observe that taking pictures sometimes results in blank images.

## Potential Solutions

The solution implemented in `bugSolution.js` involves ensuring that the camera component is fully mounted and ready before attempting to take a picture. This might involve using state management or lifecycle methods effectively to coordinate the camera initialization and image capture processes.
